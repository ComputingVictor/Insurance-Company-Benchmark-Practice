## About the project

The "Insurance Company Benchmark" database contains a series of records from different clients. Each client record contains sociodemographic attributes and values ​​that indicate the number of policies contracted on different goods. 

The business objective is, through the point of view of an insurer, to predict, using the data we have, whether a client will sign a mobile home insurance policy or not.


**For this practice, at the moment, we will have to perform only an exploratory data analysis of the dataset**.
